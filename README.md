### Built with

- React Router
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- Typescript
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was able to refresh myself on my knowledge of working with React and hooks.
Also, was able to work with Typescript, React Router and styled components libraries.


I was able to know a way to store data in the localstorage to save on making many calls to the 
server. This saved the user bandwidth and reduced the load to the server.

I was able to learn on how to make a theme toggle for a site.
